# uwaterloo-book-squash
Book squash courts (easily!) at University of Waterloo. I created this because booking squash courts through the University of Waterloo athletics website makes me want to throw my computer out of the window.

## Usage
1. Define environment variables `QUEST_USER` and `QUEST_PASS` containing your username and password for quest
2. `chmod u+x book_squash.py`
3. `./book_squash.py`
